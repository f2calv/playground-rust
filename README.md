## Local Development via vscode devcontainer

- Install vscode
- Install [Remote Development Extension Pack for vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
- Rust has loads of small files which will give you performance problems when working in a container with a mounted volume, so mount the repository in a virtual volume;

    - In vscode press F1 and select 'Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume', enter this repo URL.

- After the container image has built you are ready to Rust!
